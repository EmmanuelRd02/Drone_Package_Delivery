# Drone_Package_Delivery
In this section we will explain and justify why we design the path as in the video simulation, also we will justify and explain some security rules that we consider to avoid any privacy problem with the residents. The path that we design is with a coordinates protocol to make autonomous, but in case that the operator want to control the drone could do and make semi-autonomous with this two protocols we are able to access to any kind of places. For this path we consider a delivery of 10 package on a residential with different types of buildings and with a nonspecific order of delivery, we attached the top-view of the residential to explain how the done operate.
